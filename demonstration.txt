This third Proof of Concept is the last step before the official opening of the
Python Aboard project.  The main goal of this POC is to be stable and rich
enough tu support the Python Aboard website (or, at least, its beginnings).
1.  Provide a query builder and allow the model relations:  models should be
    connected (a user be part of a group, for instance) and the query builder
    could achieve this goal and propose even more useful possibilities to the
    model's structure.
2.  Setup the code architecture as it finally will be.  This doesn't prevent
    the PA-POC3 repository from proposing a user's configuration, but it
    shouldn't be kept in the source directory.
3.  Define a set of tools to install and uninstall bundles, plugins, check
    the user's configuration, analyze the router, query the installation via a
    Python console, reload one bundle or the whole user's configuration,
    manage a Python aboard server through a daemon, and so forth.
4.  Create a validator system, which will check the user's datas, their
    types and expected values.
