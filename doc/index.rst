Welcome to Python Aboard's documentation!
=========================================

This documentation is the Sphinx-alternative to the Python Aboard's
documentation.  In time, the documentation will be avaialble online,
on the Python Aboard's website itself, as well as in the distributed
source tree.  However, while the Python Aboard's website is not able to
handle the documentation yet, Sphinx allows to have a documentation
nevertheless.
