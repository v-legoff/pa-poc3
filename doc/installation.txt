This file describes the installation process and the first execution of the
project.

===== Python installation =====

Python Aboard uses the Python 3.3 version.  Visit http://www.python.org
website to find a package for your operating system.

If you wish to compile the Python version from the source code ensure that
you have a support for open-ssl activated when you ./configure.

===== Installing dependencies =====

Python Aboard needs several dependencies.  You may install them directly
using the scripts in src/tools:

* First run with Python 3.3 the distribute_setup.py which should install the
  'distribute' package
* Then execute dependencies.py which should install the required
  dependencies.  As this script uses the 'distribute' module, it should
  have been installed first.

This script will ask you if you want pymongo and py-postgresql.  These two
modules are only needed if you want to store your data in a MongoDB database
or if you want to store them with PotgreSQL.  You don't need either of them
if you wish to use sqlite3 or yaml.

Note: you can also build a virtual environment to install Python Aboard
dependencies.  This has been tested under a Linux Gentoo and works perfectly
well.

BEWARE: in order to launch the default configuration, which includes the
'websockets' plugin, you need the 'ws4py' package.  The most easiest way
to install it (under Windows or Linux) is to use easy_install (which is
installed with 'distribute'):

# easy_install ws4py

===== Launching the configuration example =====

You can now execute the src/tools/aboard.py.  You have to specify the path
leading to the user's configuration.  If you want to test the configuration
example, use the example directory (provided in the repository):

$ python3.3 pa-poc3/src/tools/aboard.py pa-poc3/example

If everything works right, the web server should start.  By default it is
only accessible from the local machine.  You man visit:

* http://localhost:9000/users
* http://localhost:9000/chat
