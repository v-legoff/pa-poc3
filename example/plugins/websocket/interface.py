    """Interface representing the WebSocket plugins.
    
    This class should define the abstract methods needed by the
    plugin.  Python will refuse to instanciate the plugin if some
    of this abstract methods are not defined in the subclass.  This
    is a guarantee for the user who could use this class as a base
    for the plugin documentation.
    
    The websocket plugin is designed to:
        Add the websocket server to the simple webserver
        Manage connections and disconnections on websocket points
        Send and receive datas with the connected clients.
    
    The main useful class for the user defined by this module is
    the WebSocketHandler class.  It is used to define a websocket
    entry point, that is an address where a client could connect to,
    but also some basic functions the client could perform on this URL.
    
    For instance, if you want to develop a Instant Messaging chat
    using websockets, you have to create, in your bundle, a class that
    will inherit from WebSocketHandler and will define some functions
    (like connect, disconnect, change_pseudo, send_message, kick_user...)
    that a connected client could perform.  The link between the
    client's side (written in JavaScript with jQury) and the server's
    side (written in your handler) is done through JSON requests.
    
    This mechanism is more detailed in the handler file of this
    plugin.
