"""Module containing the wiki service (WikiService class).

    This service is made to manipulate text and convert it to HTML format.
    The converting rules are highly customizable by inheriting from this
    class.  Most of the constants used to convert text to HTML
    are created in the constructor.  Therefore, others may be added
    very simply.
    
    Here is a short example that shows how to add a new markup
    to the wiki syntax.  You can add a new 'wiki.py' file in your
    'services' package placed in your bundle, and then paste the following
    code into the file:
    >>> from ext.aboard.service.default import WikiService
    >>> class wiki(WikiService)  # It's important to name -that class Wiki
    ...     def __init__(self):
    ...         Wikiservice.__init__(self)
    ...         self.add_markup("bold", "b", "<strong>{string}</strong>")
    
    You can also change the delimiters for the markup, add new regular
    expressions, delete markups, etc.  Have a look at the class methods.
