    """A route definition for the Python Aboard dispatcher.
    
    This class describes the concept of routes, which are used to
    match an URI to a corresponding callable.  When the AboardDispatcher
    receives a URI, it browses the defined routes to find one that matches
    it.  The first found one will be used and its callable will be
    called with some specific arguments.
    
    A route is identified by a pattern (converted to a regular
    expression).  Parts of the route are static while others are
    dynamic.  Consider the following example, using the regular expressions:
        images/(\d+)
    Here, the 'images/' is static.  For a user request to match
    this route, it must begin by 'images/'.  Though, after that, one
    or more numbers are expected.  Thus, the following URIs will
    match this route:
        images/1
        images/28
        images/131
    The route 'images/' WILL NOT match it, though.
    Note that, in practice, regular expressions are used behind the
    scene.  The route's patterns are easier to understand and add
    some advantages (like accept only some types of data).
