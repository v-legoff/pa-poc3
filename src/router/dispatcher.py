    """Dispatcher for Python Aboard.

    This class is used as a tool by Cherrypy.  The dispatcher contains
    the routing process.  The routes, defined in the ./route.py file,
    are added to this dispatcher and are used to redirect an HTTP
    request to a controller.

    The controllers are callables (usually instance methods) that are
    configured for a matching URI.

    Arguments given to this callable are:
        Positional: when the route expects resource identifiers [1]
        Keyword: the arguments given to a GET, POST or PUT method

    [1] Take for example the URI:
          images/1
        Here, the 'images' part won't change.  Though, the '1' part
        usually expects a integer.  This route will accept URIs like:
          images/5
          images/32
          ...
