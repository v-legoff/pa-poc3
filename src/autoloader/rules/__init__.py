"""Package containing the autoloader rules.

A rule is a sub-class of Rule, defined in the base module.
Each rule defines some default behaviour when a module is loaded
or reloaded.

For instance, when a module containing a Controller is loaded / reloaded:
    The Controller class should be extracted ffrom the module
    The previously selected class should be instanciated
    The controller should be bound with a bundle
    Finally, it should know what is the running server.

This behavior is defined in a sub-class of Rule and is exactly the same whether the
module is loaded the first time or reloaded to upgrade the source code.

The default rules are contained in the DEFAULT dictionary.  If you want
to add a new rule, create its module in this package and import it in
here.  Don't forget to add it in the DEFAULT dictionary as well.
