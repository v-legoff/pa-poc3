"""Package containing the formatters for Python Aboard.

A formatter is a class which role is to take some informations and convert them in another format.  The input informations are given as objects and the output should be a string.  Python Aboard proposes a formatter for XML, YML and so forth.

Note that the templating system is hidden behind the formatters.  For instance:
*  A GET request is sent to the server on /images/1.xml
*  The controller calls its method 'render' with the user which id = 1
*  The 'render' method look for the requested format.  Here, the XML is required
*  The XMLFormatter takes the user and return a XML representation of
   this user.

If the requested format is some kind of template, then the formatter
redirects the user representation to the template itself.

To add a new formatter, simply create a class (in your bundle, for
instance) inheriting from Formatter.  This class has to be imported,
of course, but no other code is needed to add this class to the
possible formatters and your bundle (or even others) will be able
to use it.
