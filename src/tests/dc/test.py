"""This module contains a generic class for testing data connectors.

Note that this class DOES NOT inherit from unittest.TestCase, being
an abstract test.  If you create a new data connector and would like
to test it, simply create a __init__.py and test.py file in a sub-
package called like your data connector.  In the test.py file,
create a class inherited from AbstractDCTest.
Your test.py file should contains something like:
# Don't forget the license and at least a line of documentation

from unittest import TestCase

from tests.dc.test import AbstractDCTest
from dc.{nour_connector} import {YourConnector}

class DCTest(AbstractDCTest, TestCase):
    
    name = "dc_name"
    connector = {YourConnector}

    This class is abstract.  It shouldn't be considered a regular
    test case and doesn't have enough informations to perform a test.
    It's a base test for a data connector (each data connector should
    have a class inherited from it).  This allows to test different
    data connector to check that each one has the same basic abilities
    as any other.
    
    Testing methods (some could be added, NOT MODIFIED):
        test_create -- try to create an object from a model
        test_update -- try to update an object
        test_save -- try to save and retrieve stored datas
        test_delete -- try to delete an object
        test_primary_keys -- test that the primary keys are unique
        test_auto_increment -- test the behavior of an autoincrement field
        test_auto_increment_delete -- check that old keys are not re-used
        test_default -- test the default value of a field
        test_find -- try to a retrieve a single object
        test_get_all -- try to retrieve all the created objects
