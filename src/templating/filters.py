    The methods defined in this class are usable as filters
    inside Jinja2 templates.  New methods are atuomatically added to
    the list of filters.
    
    For instance, if you define an instance method like that:
    >>>     def wiki(self, text):
    You can call it in a template like that:
        "some text"|wiki
    
    The first argument ('self' as in any instance methods) is used
    to reach global informations, such as the server.
